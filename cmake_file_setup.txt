The purpose of this text file is contain the template for 
the CMakeLists.txt files that will be in each folder used to build each C file

# Set minimum required version of CMake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)

# Set name of project (as PROJECT_NAME) and C/C++ standards
project(name_C_file C CXX ASM)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)

# Tell CMake where to find the executable source file
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}
    name_C_file.c
)

1. Create a folder for the mini project
2. Create the CMakeLists.txt
3. mkdir build 
4. cd build
5. run the command: cmake ..
6. Then run the command: make
7. Lastly to see if the C project works, run the command: ./name_C_file
